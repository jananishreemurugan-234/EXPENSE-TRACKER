# Expense Tracker (CLI Project)

## Project Overview

The Expense Tracker (CLI) is a simple Python project developed as part of the RISE Internship â€“ Python Programming.
It is designed to help students, families, and individuals manage their daily and monthly expenses in a lightweight, offline environment.
Instead of relying on complex mobile applications, this tool provides a command-line interface (CLI) that is easy to use, beginner-friendly, and efficient.

The project also incorporates file handling (JSON) for storing expenses and data visualization (matplotlib) to generate Pie Charts and Bar Charts for a better understanding of expense distribution.

## Objectives

Record daily expenses with date, category, and amount.

Save expenses in a local file (data.json).

Summarize monthly expenses per category.

Visualize data using Pie and Bar charts.

Provide a practice project for Python beginners focusing on file I/O, dictionaries, loops, and matplotlib.

## Features

### 1. Add Expense

Input: Date, Category (Food, Travel, Shopping, etc.), Amount.

Automatically saved in data.json.

### 2. Monthly Report

Filter expenses by month (YYYY-MM).

Calculate totals per category.

### 3. Charts

Pie Chart: Shows percentage distribution of each category.

Bar Chart: Compares expense amounts across categories.

### 4. Data Storage

Uses JSON format for simplicity and readability.

## How to Run

### 1. Install dependencies:

pip install matplotlib

### 2. Run the program:

python expense_tracker.py

## Technologies Used

Python 3

JSON (file handling)

Matplotlib (data visualization)

## Learning Outcomes

This project helped in understanding:

Python file I/O (JSON read/write).

Data structures (lists, dictionaries).

Filtering and aggregating data by month.

Data visualization using matplotlib.

Designing a CLI-based tool for real-world usage.
